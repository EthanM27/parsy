# parsy

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/parsy/badge/?version=latest)](http://parsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


Parsy is an easy way to combine simple, small parsers into complex,
larger parsers.  If it means anything to you, it's a monadic parser
combinator library for LL(infinity) grammars in the spirit of Parsec,
Parsnip, and Parsimmon.

Parsy requires Python 3.3 or greater.
