Parsy is an easy way to combine simple, small parsers into complex, larger
parsers. If it means anything to you, it's a monadic parser combinator library
for LL(infinity) grammars in the spirit of
[Parsec](https://github.com/haskell/parsec),
[Parsnip](http://parsnip-parser.sourceforge.net/), and
[Parsimmon](https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon).

Parsy requires Python 3.3 or greater.
